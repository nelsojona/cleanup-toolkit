# Roo Code Integration for Cleanup Toolkit

> *"After successfully completing your goal, ask: 'Please clean up the code you worked on, remove any bloat you added, and document it very clearly.'"*

Integrate systematic code cleanup workflows with **Roo Code**, the AI-powered development environment. This guide shows how to leverage Roo's intelligent coding assistance with the Cleanup Toolkit for comprehensive code improvement.

## 🎯 Why Roo Code + Cleanup Toolkit?

| Traditional Cleanup | Roo Code + Cleanup Toolkit |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| ❌ Static, rule-based | ✅ Dynamic, AI-powered analysis |
| ❌ Limited context understanding | ✅ Full project context awareness |
| ❌ Manual, error-prone | ✅ Automated with intelligent guidance |
| ❌ Generic improvements | ✅ Project-specific optimizations |

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### 1. Install Cleanup Toolkit
```bash
# In your Roo Code project
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-username/cleanup-toolkit/main/install.sh | bash
```

### 2. Configure for Roo Code
```bash
# Enable Roo Code-specific features
echo "roo_code_integration: true" >> .cleanup-toolkit/config.yml
echo "preferred_framework: roo-code" >> .cleanup-toolkit/config.yml
echo "ai_context_sharing: true" >> .cleanup-toolkit/config.yml
```

### 3. Initialize Roo Integration
```bash
# Create Roo-specific configuration
cat > .roo/cleanup-config.json << EOF
{
  "cleanup_toolkit": {
    "enabled": true,
    "auto_trigger": true,
    "context_files": [
      ".cleanup-toolkit/cleanup-context.md",
      ".cleanup-toolkit/cleanup-summary.md"
    ]
  }
}
EOF
```

### 4. Test Integration
```bash
# Create a messy file
echo "console.log('debug'); function test() { return true; }" > test.js

# Commit to trigger cleanup
git add test.js
git commit -m "test: roo code integration"

# Use generated Roo prompts for cleanup
```

## 🤖 Roo Code AI Integration

### Using Roo's AI Assistant

When the pre-commit hook triggers, use these prompts with Roo's AI:

#### 1. Project Context Analysis
```
I just completed a development goal and need to follow systematic cleanup: "Please clean up the code you worked on, remove any bloat you added, and document it very clearly."

Please analyze my project context and the files I modified:
- Read .cleanup-toolkit/cleanup-context.md for specific issues
- Understand the project structure and patterns
- Identify cleanup opportunities following best practices

Create a systematic cleanup plan that preserves functionality while improving code quality.
```

#### 2. Intelligent Code Cleanup
```
Execute cleanup systematically using your understanding of my codebase:

1. **Remove Bloat Intelligently**:
   - Debug statements that don't belong in production
   - Unused imports and variables (verify they're truly unused)
   - Dead code and commented-out sections
   - Temporary test code and scaffolding

2. **Consolidate Logic Smartly**:
   - Merge duplicate functions while preserving all use cases
   - Extract common patterns into reusable utilities
   - Simplify complex conditional logic
   - Reduce code duplication across the project

3. **Document Comprehensively**:
   - Add clear, meaningful docstrings/comments
   - Explain complex business logic
   - Document API contracts and assumptions
   - Improve variable and function names for clarity

4. **Enhance Quality**:
   - Improve error handling with specific exceptions
   - Add type hints and validation
   - Optimize performance where appropriate
   - Ensure consistent coding style

Apply these changes while maintaining full backward compatibility.
```

#### 3. Quality Verification
```
Verify that my cleanup follows best standards and maintains code quality:

1. **Functionality Preservation**:
   - Confirm all original behavior is maintained
   - Check that edge cases are still handled
   - Verify API contracts remain intact
   - Ensure no breaking changes were introduced

2. **Documentation Quality**:
   - Assess if documentation is clear and comprehensive
   - Check that complex logic is well-explained
   - Verify that function purposes are obvious
   - Confirm that maintenance will be easier

3. **Code Quality Metrics**:
   - Measure improvement in readability
   - Assess reduction in complexity
   - Evaluate error handling robustness
   - Check consistency with project patterns

Generate a detailed cleanup report with metrics and recommendations.
```

### Using Roo's Code Understanding

Leverage Roo's deep code analysis capabilities:

#### Context-Aware Refactoring
```
Using your understanding of my entire codebase, help me refactor this code following cleanup principles. Consider:
- How this code fits into the larger architecture
- Existing patterns and conventions in the project
- Dependencies and usage throughout the codebase
- Impact on other modules and components

Suggest refactoring that improves the code while maintaining consistency with the rest of the project.
```

#### Intelligent Documentation Generation
```
Based on your analysis of my codebase and coding patterns, generate comprehensive documentation for these functions that:
- Follows the documentation style used elsewhere in the project
- Explains the business logic and purpose clearly
- Documents parameters, return values, and exceptions
- Includes usage examples where helpful
- Maintains consistency with existing documentation

Make the documentation so clear that any team member can understand and maintain this code.
```

## 📚 Example Roo Code Session

### Complete AI-Guided Cleanup

1. **Trigger Cleanup Process**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: payment processing"
   # Pre-commit hook triggers Roo analysis
   ```

2. **Roo's Automatic Analysis**
   ```
   Roo: "I've analyzed your payment processing changes. I found:
   - 5 debug console.log statements
   - 2 duplicate validation functions
   - Missing error handling in 3 functions
   - Opportunities to improve documentation
   
   Would you like me to guide you through systematic cleanup?"
   ```

3. **Interactive Cleanup Guidance**
   ```
   You: "Yes, please help me clean up following best practices."
   
   Roo: "Let's start systematically:
   
   1. First, I'll help you remove the debug statements while preserving any useful logging for production.
   2. Then we'll consolidate the duplicate validation functions into a single, robust validator.
   3. Next, we'll add comprehensive error handling with specific exception types.
   4. Finally, we'll add clear documentation that explains the payment flow.
   
   Let's begin with the debug statements in payment.js..."
   ```

4. **Guided Implementation**
   ```
   Roo: "I see console.log statements on lines 15, 23, and 45. Based on your project patterns, I suggest:
   - Line 15: Remove (simple debug output)
   - Line 23: Convert to proper logging with this.logger.info()
   - Line 45: Replace with error tracking
   
   Here's the improved code..."
   ```

5. **Quality Verification**
   ```
   Roo: "Cleanup complete! Here's what we accomplished:
   - Removed 3 debug statements, converted 2 to proper logging
   - Consolidated validatePayment() and validatePaymentData() into validatePaymentRequest()
   - Added comprehensive error handling with PaymentError, ValidationError
   - Added JSDoc documentation for all public methods
   - Improved function names for clarity
   
   All tests pass and functionality is preserved. Would you like me to generate a detailed report?"
   ```

 * @param {string} name - User's full name
 * @param {string} email - User's email address
 * @returns {Promise<ValidationResult>} Validation result with details
 * @throws {ValidationError} If user data is invalid
 */
async function validateUserRegistration(name, email) {
    if (!name?.trim()) {
        throw new ValidationError("Name is required and cannot be empty");
    }
    
    if (!email?.match(/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/)) {
        throw new ValidationError("Valid email address is required");
    }
    
    // Check for existing user
    const existingUser = await this.userService.findByEmail(email);
    if (existingUser) {
        throw new ValidationError("Email address is already registered");
    }
    
    return new ValidationResult(true, "User data is valid");
}
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Roo Integration
